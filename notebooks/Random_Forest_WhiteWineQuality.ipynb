    "Welcome to this notebook where we will venture into the world of Machine Learning with one of its simplest, yet powerful techniques: Linear Regression. Here, we will predict the median price of homes in various Boston neighborhoods, using the widely-used Boston Housing dataset. This is a regression task, meaning we are trying to predict a continuous value (house prices) rather than a discrete label (e.g., spam or not-spam). Let's dive right in!"
